__Advent of Code 2019 with python.__

I use this year's aoc to learn Python programming. I'm really curious that why is it so hyped for.

## Notice
I never used Python before, so the solutions here are probably not the most efficient ones. Recurring problems' (like the intcode computer) solutions are improving (it handled by an object in day 7), but I probably do not refactor the previous solutions to them.

Workdir needs to be set up to project root before running the scripts.
