__Advent of Code 2019 with python.__

I use this year's aoc to learn Python programming. I'm really curious that why is it so hyped for.

## Notice
I never used Python before, so the solutions here are probably not the most efficient ones.

The project is set up for IDE usage (PyCharm). If you want to run directly from terminal, you have to handle module files, and path separators.
